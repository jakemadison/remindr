A stupidly-named, stupidly simple reminder app.


So, originally the idea was that this was going to text straight to the phone, but the reception side of that is 
annoying.

Our options then are:
=> start a twitter account, download the twitter app, use that to send notifications.
=> start a gmail account, hook that up to the phone, use that to send notifications.
=> somehow try and integrate with duo notifications app?
=> try and make a native app?  Would work better with an android phone :<


It would be nice to use this as an excuse to learn something new.  But what?  Set up celery queues to post to twitter?
(For one person... a worker once per hour?)
Do it in node.js?
ugh, do it in php?

Maybe I should just pick a different project to do those in.
